### Bibliophile

A website meant for book lovers.

* Bibliophile is primarily a book recommendation website, that recommends using:
    1. Collaborative Filtering
    2. Content-based Filtering
  
* It also allows users to add books to their "Wishlist", "Currently Reading" or "Books Read". Users can also rate and review books that they have read.
* For each book, it creates a cool word cloud based on the reviews submitted by the users. 
* We use the Kaggle Dataset: Book Recommendation Dataset, to train our recommendation systems. 
* We also use the Google Books API to retrieve extra book information, such as description and category, given the books in the Kaggle dataset. This extra info retrieved from     the API is used for content based filtering.
* Users can also search for books by title.
